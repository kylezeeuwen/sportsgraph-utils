# SportsGraph Utils

This project contains the utilities I used to gather data for the sportsgraph-alpha project.
The sportsgraph-utils repository is not as well maintained as some of my others - I created it after the fact during a refactor of sportsgraph-alpha, and as such, may not even work out of the box. Apologies.

The node_modules/nhl-api was a straight git clone of https://github.com/sintaxi/nhl-api.
When I have a chance to clean up this repo (likely when I generate a data set for a league other than the NHL) I will use a proper sub modules include.
